# Spam_SMS_classifier_Using_ML


I acquired a dataset consisting of both spam and non-spam text data. I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on this dataset, utilizing graph visualization techniques to explore its characteristics. Employing techniques such as TfidfVectorizer and tokenization, I performed in-depth analysis. As a result, I developed a machine learning model capable of classifying the data into spam or non-spam categories through training.
